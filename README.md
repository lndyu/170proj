# CS 170 Project Fall 2021

Project Description:
You are given a list of tasks that you have the option to complete. Each task has a profit value and a deadline. After the deadline, the profit of the task will begin to decrement with an exponential function. You are only given a certain amount of time to complete as many of these tasks as you can. Our goal is to come up with an algorithm that will determine a sequence that will maximize the total profit.

Requirements:

Python 3.6+

Files:
- `parse.py`: functions to read/write inputs and outputs
- `solver.py`: where you should be writing your code to solve inputs
- `Task.py`: contains a class that is useful for processing inputs

When writing inputs/outputs:
- Make sure you use the functions `write_input_file` and `write_output_file` provided
- Run the functions `read_input_file` and `read_output_file` to validate your files before submitting!
- These are the functions run by the autograder to validate submissions
